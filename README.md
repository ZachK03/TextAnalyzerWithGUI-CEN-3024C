# Text Analyzer With GUI
An extended version of the [Text Analyzer Repository](https://github.com/ZachK03/TextAnalyzer-CEN-3024C) including a GUI created using JavaFX which allows the user to select the number of words they wish to see. 

## Development Process
Most of the work put into this project was designing the UI in a way that I thought looked decent. Using JavaFX before seemed to only allow for a developer to make mediocre looking UI, however, after this project I feel much more capable in terms of creating clean, aesthetic UI. 

Most development was using SceneBuilder, however, when it came to the TableView I did have problems with adding the data to it. However, after some research I was able to figure out that I needed to use `setCellValueFactory()`.
